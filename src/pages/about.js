          <p>
            My name is Marquet, a lot of my friends call me Quet, and handle online is QuetCodesFire. 
            I'm a Web Developer with experiences building software in a number of languages and frameworks
            and an overall tech geek in general. With my love and passion for coding and all things tech in general
            I have another love in teaching others about tech. With this I have started my journey of teaching others
            about coding, tech, and how to make a career out of it.
